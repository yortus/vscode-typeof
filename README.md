## What is this?

This project uses a fork of TypeScript for VSCode language services, where `typeof` works with any expression.

This is a quick way to play with the TypeScript proposal at [#6606](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript/issues/6606).

## Install and Open in VS Code

`npm install "yortus/vscode-typeof"`

`code ./node_modules/vscode-typeof`
